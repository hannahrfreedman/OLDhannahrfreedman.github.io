</div>
<p>I am from Baltimore, Maryland, and am a senior majoring in American Studies and Computer Science. I am looking for job and partnership opportunities related to social justice, data transparency, journalism and data visualization, and communication addressing social and economic inequalities. My passions for social justice and equity have led to organizing experience on environmental justice, sustainable development, and Palestinian solidarity. My academic interests include political theory, anthropology, systems thinking, and web design/programming for social change. Outside of academia and activism, I am interested in community economic development, direct democracy, facilitation and community building, photography, and cooking.<br>Languages: English (native) and Spanish (advanced)</p>
